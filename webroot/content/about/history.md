<h2>1. Today&mdash;2014 to Present</h2>

Effective 23 October 2014, the <a href="/specifications/lrmi_1">LRMI 1.1 specification</a> was transferred to the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI). A full description of the terms of the transfer <a href="/transfer_announcement">is available</a>. The responsibility of stewardship and the further development of the LRMI specification belongs to a new permanent LRMI Task Group (LTG) as an adjunct to DCMI's long-standing Education Community. The work of the LTG is advanced through the definition of specific work packages with specific tasks, goals, and timeframes.

<h2>2. Initial Development Phase&mdash;2011&ndash;2014</h2>

<p>Since its establishment in 2011, the Learning Resource Metadata Initiative (LRMI) has worked to make it easier to publish, discover, and deliver quality educational resources on the web.</p>

<p>Co-led from spring 2011 through fall 2014 by the Association of Educational Publishers&mdash;the 501(c)(3) division of the Association of American Publishers&mdash;and Creative Commons, and funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the LRMI has developed a <strong>common metadata framework</strong> for describing or "tagging" learning resources on the web. This framework is a key first step in developing a richer, more fruitful search experience for educators and learners. Once a critical mass of educational content has been tagged to a universal framework, it becomes much easier to parse and filter that content, opening up tremendous possibilities for search and delivery.</p>

<p>The LRMI was spurred by the announcement in 2011 of Schema.org, a project by Bing, Google, and Yahoo! to create a standard way of tagging online content. While not directly connected, Schema.org created the opportunity for initiatives such as the LRMI by establishing a standard markup schema for general web content and then encouraging specialized communities and industries to extend this schema to meet their needs. The metadata schema developed by the LRMI was adopted by Schema.org in April 2013, meaning that anyone who publishes or curates educational content can now use LRMI markup to provide rich, education-specific metadata about their resources with the confidence that this metadata will be recognized by major search engines.</p>

<h3>Association of Educational Publishers (AEP)</h3>

<p><img src="/images/aep-logo-200.png" alt="AEP logo" width="150" /></p>

<p>Founded in 1895, the Association of Educational Publishers (AEP) served for more than a century as the only professional organization serving the diverse needs of the entire educational resource community. Originally formed to meet the needs of a few key educational journals, the membership of AEP expanded over the years to include the wide range of individuals, institutions, and businesses dedicated to delivering progressive learning resources in all media and for any educational setting.</p>

<p>For many years, AEP remained at the forefront of the educational publishing industry, leading initiatives that helped drive the future of content development and delivery. It took a leading role in many efforts supporting the industry, including the Learning Resource Metadata Initiative (LRMI), which is changing the way educational materials are found on the Internet; awards programs and conferences; and representation of educational publishers on matters such as new legislation and funding.</p>

<p><img src="/images/AAP_Logo-200.png" alt="AAP logo" width="150" /></p>

<p>In 2013, AEP merged with the School Division of the Association of American Publishers (AAP) to form the PreK-12 Learning Group. That group continues working to inform and advance the industry and to define and applaud excellence in the field.</p>

<p>AEP now serves as the 501(c)(3) arm of AAP, and it has continued to lead and administer the LRMI throughout the course of its grant funding.</p>

<h3>Creative Commons (CC)</h3>

<p><img src="/images/creativeCommons-logo.png" alt="Creative Commons logo" width="150" /></p>

<p>With the Internet, universal access to education is possible, but its potential is hindered by outdated copyright laws and incompatible technologies. Creative Commons works to minimize these barriers, by providing licenses and tools that anyone, from individual creators to large companies and institutions, can use to share their educational materials with the world. CC licenses are a simple, standardized way to keep your copyright while allowing certain uses of your work — a “some rights reserved” approach that builds upon the “all rights reserved” concept of traditional copyright. CC licenses make textbooks and lesson plans easy to find, easy to share, and easy to customize and combine — helping to realize the full benefits of digitally enabled education.</p>

<p>Throughout the initiative, Creative Commons has provided expert knowledge and leadership in developing and stewarding critical legal and technology infrastructure to the Learning Resource Metadata Initiative, ensuring interoperability of openly licensed educational materials.</p>

<h2>3. Founding Technical Working Group</h2>

<p>For phase 1 of the LRMI project, in 2011, a Technical Working Group was formed and was charged with producing—with the input of an official <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="#fag">Advisory Group</a></span> and informed by public comment and feedback—a common metadata vocabulary for learning resources. The group submitted this framework to Schema.org (a project by Bing, Google, and Yahoo! to develop and encourage use of metadata vocabularies), and it was accepted in April 2013. The group also has worked on recommendations for long-term governance of the standard.</p>
