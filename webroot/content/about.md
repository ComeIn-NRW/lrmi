# LRMI Today—2014 to Present

Effective 23 October 2014, the [LRMI 1.1 specification](/lrmi-1-1/) was [transferred to the Dublin Core Metadata Initiatve](/2014/10/23/lrmi-transfers-stewardship/) (DCMI). A full description of the terms of the transfer [is available](/2014/10/23/lrmi-transfers-stewardship/). The responsibility of stewardship and the further development of the LRMI specification belongs to a new permanent LRMI Task Group (TG) as an adjunct to DCMI’s long-standing Education Community. The work of the TG is advanced through the definition of specific work packages with specific tasks, goals, and timeframes.
