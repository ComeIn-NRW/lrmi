Resources for LRMI Project.

2018-01-10: This repo is transitioning to serve as the back-end for a Hugo-driven website.
* The directory webroot/ is the new top-level directory for LRMI content - see [webroot/README.md](https://github.com/dcmi/lrmi/blob/master/webroot/README.md).
* The directories lrmi_examples/, lrmi_terms/, and lrmi_vocabs/ will become superseded by webroot/.
