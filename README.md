This repository provides in-development and informative resources about [LRMI](https://www.dublincore.org/about/lrmi/), including:
* [LRMI Terms](lrmi_terms/): development versions of RDF definitions of LRMI Terms in Turtle;
* [LRMI Vocabs](lrmi_vocabs): development versions of RDF definitions of concept schemes relevant to LRMI terms;
* [LRMI Examples](lrmi_examples): high level examples of LRMI.

For the stable, normative versions of the terms and concept schemes, see [LRMI Specifications](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/lrmi/) on the DCMI website.

To contribute to the development of LRMI please join the [DCMI LRMI Task Group](https://www.dublincore.org/groups/lrmi-task-group/)

## About LRMI
The [LRMI specification](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/lrmi/) is a collection of classes, properties and concept schemes for markup and description of educational resources. This vocabulary is designed to be used alongside other resource description vocabularies such as those provided by DCMI, [Schema.org](https://schema.org) and other standards. A significant part of the LRMI specification is mirrored under the [schema.org/LearningResource](https://schema.org/LearningResource) class.

## LRMI Development
The specification is curated by the DCMI [LRMI Task Group](https://www.dublincore.org/groups/lrmi-task-group/), mainly through monthly calls at 07:00 (Pacific Time) on the first Tuesday of the month. For information about these calls, including agenda and further discussion, join the [DC-LRMI Task Group mail list](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=DC-LRMI).
