* [LRMI Terms](lrmi_terms): This document is an up-to-date specification in RDF of the LRMI 1.1 metadata terms.

* [LRMI 1.1](lrmi_1): The LRMI 1.1 specification is a collection of classes and properties for markup and description of educational resources. The specification builds on the extensive vocabulary provided by [Schema.org](https://schema.org) and other standards. 

* [Concept Schemes](concept_schemes): The LRMI concept schemes are small sets of concepts for use as values with the LRMI properties in learning resource description and Web markup. Since the properties for which these concepts are intended <u>also exists</u> as [Schema.org properties](https://schema.org), the concepts in this concept scheme can be used with a level of certainty in Web markup. The concepts in the vocabularies have been declared in RDF using the W3C's [*Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS)*](https://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/).
