The LRMI project was begun in the the spring of 2011 by the *Association of Educational Publishers* —the 501(c)(3) division of the *Association of American Publishers* —and *Creative Commons*, and was funded by the *Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation* and the *William and Flora Hewlett Foundation*. The initial goal was the development of a set of properties and classes to augment [Schema.org](http://schema.org/) for description of learning resources. In the fall of 2014, curation and further development of the initial 1.1 specification was [transferred to DCMI](transfer_announcement) for stewardship and further development under the guidance of the [*LRMI Task Group*](/task_group/) (LTG).

Shortly after the transfer in 2014, the LTG published the 1.1 specification in fully conformant RDF. Recently, the LTG published [four concept schemes](/specifications/concept_schemes/) using the W3C's Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) to provide values for key properties in the LRMI schema. The LTG has extended it's work to provide support for development of the [Schema.org Course entity](http://schema.org/Course), and, most recently, the work of the Schema.org Educational and Occupational Credentials [Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/eocred-schema/).
