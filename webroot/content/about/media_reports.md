<p><strong>2013/11/08 | AEP<br />EdTech Digest Doubles Up on LRMI Coverage</strong></p>

<p><em>EdTech Digest</em> included LRMI-related articles on November 6 and 7, 2013. On November 6, an article titled "Caution: Opportunity Ahead" by Tim Farquer featured  the Illinois Shared Learning Environment (ISLE) and its use of LRMI. Farquer discussed how the ISLE "is designed to empower educators and learners with integrated data and tools that drive student success from Pre-K to career."</p>

<p>In "The LRMI", an interview with LRMI Project Manager Dave Gladney appearing on November 7, Victor Rivero asks about LRMI's history, value to both educators and content providers, and current projects. Gladney described how the LRMI can help educators find the resources they seek while also helping content providers improve the online discoverability of their products and services.

<p><strong>2013/10/07 |AEP<br />EdNET Insight Article Features the Learning Registry, LRMI</strong></p>


<p>"Imagine a world in which teachers can easily sift through the millions of educational resources available online and find the materials that best meet their needs," wrote LRMI Project Manager Dave Gladney in an article appearing in the October 4, 2013, issue of <a href="http://www.ednetinsight.com/"><em>EdNET Insight</em></a>. His article, titled "The Learning Registry and the Learning Resource Metadata Initiative: Powerful Tools to Personalize Learning," described how the Learning Registry and the LRMI can combine to help make that possible.</p>

<p>Citing speakers from the LRMI workshop in Denver on September 22, Gladney gave updates on both the Learning Registry and the LRMI. "The ever-growing body of educational resources available through the Learning Registry, coupled with the ability to pinpoint resources by criteria such as content area, age range, and alignment with specific educational standards as allowed by LRMI metadata, offers educators a powerful tool in the drive to provide personalized learning opportunities to all students," concluded Gladney.</p>

<p><strong>2012/11/05 | AEP<br />The LRMI: Part of a "Potent Alphabet Soup"</strong></p>


<p>In an article published on November 2nd by <em>EdSurge News</em>, consultant and author Frank Catalano describes a "potent alphabet soup" of initiatives that may reconfigure the "underlying plumbing" for digital learning content. Catalano gives capsule summaries of the Learning Resource Metadata Initiative (LRMI), Learning Registry, and Shared Learning Infrastructure (SLI).</p>

<p>In the article, Catalano also offers his estimate of what he calls the "Industry Cluelessness Factor" (ICF) for each of these initiatives. According to Catalano, the LRMI has the broadest level of industry awareness, with an ICF of 50%. Meanwhile, he assigns cluelessness factors of 70% to the Learning Registry and and even higher 90% to the Shared Learning Infrastructure, developed under the aegis of the Shared Learning Collaborative.</p>

<p>Catalano says content companies should pay attention to the LRMI because once its specification has been approved by Schema.org, the major search engines will begin using it in delivering search results. "If you don’t use LRMI tags, your digital content may not be as discoverable in the major search engines where many educators begin looking for classroom materials," writes Catalano. "Not taking part in LRMI may hurt your content's SEO."</p>

<p><strong>2012/07/03 | AEP<br />How Will Student Data Be Used?</strong></p>

<p>MindShift, KQED's education blog — July 3, 2012</p>
	
<p>Frank Catalano describes—as succinctly as possible—the Shared Learning Infrastructure and the Shared Learning Collaborative and where LRMI fits in.</p>
	
<p>"…a new initiative, supported by state education leaders and funded by prominent foundations, plans to provide a place in the cloud for each state to store all data for every student, using 'free' open source software. And, in the process, student achievement information will be connected to instructional apps and web resources. That is, as long as the effort can address concerns about technology, privacy, and whether enough education companies will want to build products for a system that could undermine parts of their own businesses.”</p>

<p><strong>2012/05/31<br />Metadata acronyms – MLR or LRMI?</strong></p>

<p>This post on <em>e-learning standards</em>, a blog run by the Australian-based NSW Curriculum and Learning Innovation Centre, explores two metadata projects that have evolved in parallel: Metadata for Learning Resources (MLR) and LRMI.</p>
	
<p>According to the author, Evan Bailey, MLR aims to "harmonise [sic] both LOM and Dublin Core metadata, as it tries to enable both the 'learning object' aspects of LOM and the "entity-relationship model of the Semantic Web and the Dublin Core Abstract Model’ (HOEL and MASON (2011) p 6)."</p>
	
<p>It's important to note that Bailey misstates the relationship between schema.org and LRMI–the search engines in no way "promote" or support LRMI. If they choose to recognize the LRMI spec as the learning resource extension to Schema.org, perhaps it could be said they endorse the work. But in its proposal stage, they have not shown particular support one way or the other.

<p><strong>2011/06/09 | AEP<br />Searching for Educational Resources Online Is About to Get Much Easier, GOOD Education</strong></p>

<p><em>GOOD Education – June 9th, 2011</em></p>
	
<p>One of the frustrating things about search engines has always been the random hodgepodge of results you get after you click "search." That's especially true for people looking for educational resources online. If you type in "chemistry," links to dating sites pop up as well as a whole host of science-related content. Now Creative Commons and the Association of Educational Publishers are teaming up to establish the <a href="http://www.aepweb.org/mediacenter/AEP-CC-Schema_6-7-11.htm">Learning Resources Framework Initiative</a> a common education content framework which hopes to provide better search results for learning-related material on the web.</p>

<p><strong>2011/06/08 | AEP<br />Online Searches for Educational Resources to Improve, World of Learning</strong></p>

<p><em>World of Learning – June 8th, 2011</em></p>
	
<p>One of the tools search engines use to help serve you the best information is relevance. Vastly oversimplified, this means that if you do a search on the word "blue", search engines crawl through sites looking for content that contain the word "blue". They know that content with "blue" in the headline, URL or first paragraph is more important that something with "blue" at the bottom of a page or in a caption. Even with that logic, a search on "blue" will get you more than 2 billion results.</p>
	
<p>What if you're searching online for resources to use in a classroom? No one wants to wade through 2 billion results. Things are about to get a lot better for educators.</p>
